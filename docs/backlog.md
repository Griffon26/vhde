# Backlog

This page lists work that needs to be done in order of priority. It is a mix of
functionality and code improvements. Sub-bullets are used for further
explanation or subdivision.

The identifiers (VHDE-n) are only used to refer to other items on the list and
do not indicate priority.

1. VHDE-14: Automatically generate a .layout file when it's missing
1. VHDE-2: Complete support for the currently implemented VHDL items (remove shortcuts)
1. VHDE-3: Decide on the use of pointers (raw pointers vs unique_ptr + documenting the decision)
1. VHDE-1: Get TravisCI builds to work
