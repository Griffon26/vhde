# Backlog

This page lists work that needs to be done in order of priority. It is a mix of
functionality and code improvements. Sub-bullets are used for further
explanation or subdivision.

The identifiers (`VHDE-nn`) are only used to refer to other items on the list
and do not indicate priority.

1. `VHDE-02`: Complete support for the currently implemented VHDL items (remove shortcuts)
1. `VHDE-03`: Decide on the use of pointers (raw pointers vs unique_ptr + documenting the decision)
1. `VHDE-01`: Get TravisCI builds to work
1. `VHDE-11`: Add coverity static analysis to Travis build (deps on `VHDE-01`)
1. `VHDE-08`: Improve exception safety (deps on `VHDE-03`)
1. `VHDE-13`: Resolve conflicts between .layout and .vhd files
1. `VHDE-12`: Remove restriction of 1 architecture per file
1. `VHDE-05`: Add a comment for each class describing its reponsibility
1. `VHDE-15`: Add support for library and use clauses
1. `VHDE-16`: Add support for configuration declaration
1. `VHDE-17`: Add support for package declaration and body
1. `VHDE-06`: Port from clutter to GTK+ Scene Graph Kit (GSK), once broadly available
1. `VHDE-04`: Create a usable GUI (deps on `VHDE-06`)
1. `VHDE-09`: Figure out how to do user-assisted routing of signals in a diagram
1. `VHDE-10`: Add tests
1. `VHDE-18`: Write user manual
1. ...
1. `VHDE-07`: Verilog support (don't hold your breath)
