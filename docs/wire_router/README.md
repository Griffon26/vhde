# Wire router

This folder contains research done for a wire routing algorithm.
All research is documented in an ipython notebook.

To use it use following commands from this folder:

```shell
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook
```

Your browser will be opened with the notebooks of this folder.
Currently this is only one messy notebook.

Using `shift`-`enter` you can jump through the cells to see the outputs.
