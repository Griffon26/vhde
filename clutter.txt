mouse actions:

L                   select (needed for keyboard actions like delete)
double L            edit name
R                   context menu
R + drag            context menu
L + drag body       move component
L + drag text       move text (only for component text, port text is fixed)
L + drag edge       resize component
ctrl L + drag any   move component
ctrl R + drag any   resize component

L + drag bg         selection rectangle
ctrl L + drag bg    scroll

wheel               scroll up/down
shift wheel         scroll left/right
ctrl wheel          zoom in/out on cursor





things to consider:

- diagram elements are group actor containing other actors
- actors have property that points to diagram element
- diagram element registers for actors' signals

- selection is a hierarchical diagram element

- each diagram element determines its own movement based on provided mouse
  motion events

- transitory elements (ghost while dragging multiple selection)



------
- how to implement tolerance when picking up the edge of an object for
  resizing
- how to implement changing mouse cursor when hovering over an edge
answer to both:
- override and change pick when necessary, otherwise just use existing area of
  an actor


- how to implement lower/raise? How does one actor know where it is in the
  sort order?
