# An example VHDE project file
#
# This file lists all VHDL files of a project along with a mode that indicates
# if architectures contained in that file should be editable as a diagram in
# VHDE or as text in a text editor.
#
# The order in the list is the order that the files will be shown in the
# project overview.
#
# Layout files are not included in the project file and are assumed to have the
# same name as the VHDL files, but with a .layout extension.
